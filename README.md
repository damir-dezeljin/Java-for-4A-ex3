# An h1 header

Paragraphs are separated by
a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:
- this one
- that one
  - and this is two.one
- the other one

*Note* that not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.
> Block quotes are

## <a name="hdr2"></a> An h2 header

Here's a numbered list:

1. first item
   1. first -> 1<sup>st</sup>
   1. first -> 2<sup>nd</sup>
1. second item
1. third item

Here's a code block sample:

```
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
```

And here is a block of python colored code:
(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the

```python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(11,20):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
```


## Another header 2

Here's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar), and to a [local
doc](local-doc.html), and to the 2<sup>nd</sup> heading 2 An [h2 header](#hdr2).
